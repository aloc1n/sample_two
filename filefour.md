### Data types - a reminder

* **Class** - a class is a category of thing.  
* **Attributes** - attributes of a class are _characteristics_ that every instance of that class has.  
* **Methods** - are written as _verbs_, usually action words or _short action phrases_ and defines behaviour/actions.  
* **Instances** - an instance is an occurrence or version of any object.  
* **Object** - is a collection of key-value pairs, a collection of things, but in the case of objects, we are pairing data together.  
* **String** - is a data type used to represent text, containing letters, spaces, numbers, and special characters.  
* **Integers** - is a whole number and can be be positive, negative, or zero. They are never a fraction, nor have have decimal places.  
* **Floats** - are numbers that contain _floating_ decimal points. They can be positive or negative.  
* **Boolean** - is either true or false.  
* **Array** - is a data structure that represents a _group of things_. It is an ordered, indexed collection of data in a row and each one is numbered starting from zero. Arrays are _written in square brackets_ in code, for example ``"[data type one, data type two, data type three]"``.  
* **Syntax** - is the way we write. It is the set of rules that defines the combinations of symbols that are considered to be a correctly structured document or fragment in that language.
